# Debian 12 Goss config

## Overview

based on CIS 1.0.1

Ability to audit a system using a lightweight binary to check the current state.

This is:

- very small 11MB
- lightweight
- self contained

It works using a set of configuration files and directories to audit STIG of Debian 12.

Tested on

- Debian 12

## Requirements

You must have [goss](https://github.com/goss-org/goss/) available to your host you would like to test.

You must have sudo/root access to the system as some commands require privilege information.

Assuming you have already clone this repository you can run goss from where you wish.

Please refer to the audit documentation for usage.

- [readthedocs](https://ansible-lockdown.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

This also works alongside the [Ansible Lockdown DEBIAN12-CIS role](https://github.com/ansible-lockdown/DEBIAN12-CIS)

Which will:

- install
- audit
- remediate
- audit
